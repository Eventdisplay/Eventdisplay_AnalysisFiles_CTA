# Mapping file for merging prod-2 data from standard 197-telescope
# simulation with SC-SST from dedicated 102-telescope simulation
# into subset '2Q'.

# 4 LSTs from standard simulation (new IDs: 1 to 4):
1 1,2,4,5 

# 24 MSTs from std. sim. (new IDs: 5 to 28):
1 7,8,11,12,14-22,29-32,40-42,49-52

# All 74 SC-SSTs are taken from the special SC-SST simulation.
# Note that these are the original IDs as in the standard simulation
# even though there are ignored telescopes in that simulation.
# Resulting IDs in the merged file are 29 to 96.
# To have them appear in ascending order, the input telescope IDs must also
# be in ascending order:
2 9,13,27,28,34-39,47,48,54-59, 97-150

# 2Q:              
#   LST(4):1,2,4,5,  
#   MST(24):7,8,11,12,14-22,29-32,40-42,49-52,                    
#   SC-SST(72):9,13,27,28,34-39,47,48,54-59, 97-150
